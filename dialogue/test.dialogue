Old man: You look lost child, what are you doing here ?
Player: Hi old man, I'm trying to find the sea but I think this is not the right place. 
Old man: Don't worry you little bastard, the sea is just around the corner, look, just follow this path and you will reach the little sea town of Barna.
Old man: It's a little and pacefull village all the year but the town festival starter yesterday so you might find some people to meet.
Player: Thank's old man I'm going now.

Old man: Don't worry young child, my name is not important in this story, just call me the old man that lives in the countryside.

Old man: HO HO HO ...
