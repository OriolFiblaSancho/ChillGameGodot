Dev: Hi player, this is just a demo that I made to understand how godot works
Dev: There's no much to do here, walk around, talk to that npc at the end of the map and watch the sea at the other level.
Dev: I upload the game like this because i'm tired of it and I just want to finish it.
Dev: Hope you like it. <3
Player: You suck at doing games.
Dev: Thanks, I know
